### General Changes

- A CockroachDB process now flushes its logs upon receiving `SIGHUP` instead of `SIGUSR1` as it did earlier. This is aimed to simplify the automation of process monitoring, test and backup tools. [#23783][#23783]
- Information about zone config usage is now included in diagnostic reports. [#23750][#23750]

### Enterprise Edition Changes

- Added `cloudstorage.timeout` setting for import/export operations. [#23776][#23776]

### SQL Language Changes

- SQL features introduced in version 2.0 cannot be used in clusters which are not upgraded fully to v2.0. [#24013][#24013]
- Added `escape` option to the encode and decode builtins. [#23781][#23781]
- Introduced a series of Postgres-compatible privilege-related builtin functions. [#23839][#23839]
- Added `pg_language` table to the `pg_catalog`. [#23839][#23839]
- Added the `anyarray` type to the `pg_type` catalog. [#23836][#23836]
- Retriable errors on schema change operations are now less likely to be returned to clients; more operations are retried internally. [#24050][#24050]

### Command-Line Changes

- The client commands now reports a warning if the connection URL is specified by the `--url` as well as some other command-line argument.  If you use the `--url` flag, do not set any other connection flags.
- Added per-node heap profiles to the `debug zip` command output. [#23858][#23858]

### Admin UI Changes

- More debug pages are now locked down by the `server.remote_debugging.mode` cluster setting. [#24022][#24022]
- The network diagnositcs report will no longer crash when the latencies are very small or on a single node cluster. [#23868][#23868]
- Fixed the flicker in the node map as data was being reloaded. [#23757][#23757]
- Fixed the text overflowing past the table cell boundaries on the Jobs page. [#23748][#23748]
- Updated the labels for the Snapshots graph on the Replication dashboard to be more specific. [#23742][#23742]
- Fixed a bug where graphs would not display on clusters with large numbers of nodes. [#24045][#24045]
- Decommissioned nodes no longer appear in the node selection dropdown on the Metrics page. [#23800][#23800]
- Fixed a condition where a persistent trailing dip could appear in graphs for longer time periods. [#23874][#23874]

### Bug Fixes

- Redacted string settings values in debug API responses. [#24070][#24070]
- Old replicas are now garbage collected in a more timely fashion after a node has been offline for a long time (this bug only exists in recent v2.0 alpha/beta releases, not in v1.1). [#24066][#24066]
- Fixed a bug where some inverted index queries could return incorrect results. [#23968][#23968]
- Fixed behaviour of `@>` operator with arrays and scalars. [#23969][#23969]
- Inverted indexes can no longer be hinted for inappropriate queries. [#23989][#23989]
- Enforced minimum privileges for `admin` role. [#23935][#23935]
- A panic is now avoided if the SQL audit log dir does not exist when the node is started. [#23928][#23928]
- Supported Postgres syntax for `USING GIN`. [#23910][#23910]
- Fixed a bug where `INSERT`/`DELETE`/`UPDATE`/`UPSERT` may lose updates if run using `WITH` or the `[ ... ]` syntax. [#23895][#23895]
- Made sure that all builtins have a unique Postgres OID for compatibility. [#23880][#23880]
- Fixed an error message generated by the experimental scrub feature. [#23845][#23845]
- Fixed a bug where `CREATE VIEW` after `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` would fail to register the dependency on the newly added column. [#23845][#23845]
- Fixed crashes or incorrect results when combining an `OUTER JOIN` with a `VALUES` clause that contains only `NULL` values on a column (or other subqueries which result in a `NULL` column). [#23838][#23838]
- Fixed rare nil pointer exception in rebalance target selection. [#23807][#23807]
- `cockroach zone set` will now automatically retry if it encounters an error while setting zone configurations. [#23782][#23782]
- Fixed a bug where closing a connection in the middle of executing a query sometimes crashed the server. [#23761][#23761]
- Fixed a bug where expressions could be mistakenly considered equal, despite their types being different. [#23722][#23722]
- Fixed a bug where the `RANGE COUNT` metric on the cluster overview could significantly undercount the number of ranges. [#23746][#23746]
- The client URL reported upon `cockroach start` now does not include the option `application_name`. [#23894][#23894]

### Performance Improvements

- Improved cluster performance during overload scenarios. [#23884][#23884]
